7-7-7

A jackpot algorithm that let's you choose how many users win the jackpot, freebies or anything for that matter and the rest is just random stuff that doesn't cost the business any money. Exactly like CRED's jackpot games where you need to get 7-7-7 to win but rarely anybody wins. People instead get coupons which I am sure the company wants the users to get which in return boosts sales. There ought to be some algo where you set the number of total wins right? 

Please review and suggest changes if any.
